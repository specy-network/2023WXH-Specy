      With Specy Network, users can seamlessly execute their Dapp in the future
      based on predefined conditions using multi-chain data. For example, they
      can automatically update a Merkle root of a reward list daily, implement
      automated trading strategies that leverage both on-chain and off-chain
      data, and execute token transactions at optimal prices through automated
      buying and selling.

      To meet these high expectations, Specy Network utilizes a trusted
      specification based on the domain-specific asset language (DSAL). This
      empowers developers to easily define task conditions and required outcomes
      using both on-chain and off-chain data. Moreover, the network ensures
      reliable task execution verification through computational proofs based on
      TEE signatures or zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
