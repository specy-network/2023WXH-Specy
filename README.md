## Introduction

Specy Network is a COSMOS Layer1 for verifiable low-code automation on multichains

With Specy Network, users can seamlessly execute their Dapp in the future based on predefined conditions using multi-chain data. 

To meet these high expectations, Specy Network utilizes a trusted specification based on the automation language . This empowers developers to easily define task conditions and required outcomes using both on-chain and off-chain data. Moreover, the network ensures reliable task execution verification through computational proofs based on TEE signatures or zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

### Motivation

#### automation Architecture


##### complicated programing
